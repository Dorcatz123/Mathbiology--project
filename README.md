### Project-Mathbiology-paper: This is a mini project I did using mathematical modelling to do analysis and predictions. All the mathematical analysis and the simulations are done by me in order to elaborate on the research done by: 'Drexler, D. A., Sapi, J., & Kovacs, L. (2017). "Modeling of tumor growth incorporating the effects of necrosis and the effect of Bevacizumab." *Hindawi Complexity*, 2017, 10.'
