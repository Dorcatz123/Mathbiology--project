### Project-Mathbiology-paper: This is a mini project I did using mathematical modelling to do analysis and predictions based on a tumor grwoth model and the mixed order pharmacokinetics of the drug Bevacizumab. All the mathematical analysis and the simulations are done by me in order to elaborate on the research done by: 'Drexler, D. A., Sapi, J., & Kovacs, L. (2017). "Modeling of tumor growth incorporating the effects of necrosis and the effect of Bevacizumab." *Hindawi Complexity*, 2017, 10.' Check out the mathbio paper.ipynb for an introduction and the mathematical analysis.
